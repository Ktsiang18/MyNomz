Nomz aims to destigmitize hunger and combat waste by connecting those with leftovers with those in need. 

Nomz implements Google's Geolocation API to locate the closest donors and receivers. We used Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend, Heroku for deployment.
